      <h1>My Privacy Policy</h1>  
    </header>

    <p class="standfirst">An explanation of the privacy policy on this website. Spoiler alert: it's very short.</p>

    <p>Here is the full privacy policy for this website.</p>

    <blockquote cite="https://liamnugent.me/about#privacy"><p>This is not a commercial website and, when I thought about it, I realised that there is simply nothing about you that I categorically need to know! It's not that I'm not interested in you. It's just that it's really none of my business.</p>

    <p>I've resisted the urge to use Google Analytics on the site myself so I collect no data about you. No Facebook pixels. No cookie files. Nothing. You can come and go as you please. :-)</p>

    <p>Sure, on a commercial website, some things do need to be measured and there are ways and means to do that—but not here. No-one likes a creep.</p></blockquote>

    <p>Hopefully, it's pretty self-explanatory and maybe it makes you stop and think.</p>

    <p>If you're in charge of any websites or apps, have a think about what you really need to know about your users. Don't just get caught in the trap of collecting as much info as you can now and worrying about using it later. Why bother? It's a fact that most of the data collected will never be used. Never! It just gets collected and then burns energy sitting on a computer somewhere.</p>

    <h2>Measure–<em>mindfully!</em></h2>
    <p>Yes! Measure things! Track your product and make sure you're hitting your metrics. But <em>think about it</em> first. Don't just grab everything you can.</p>

    <p>Imagine that you were asking people for this information in person, face-to-face. Would you feel a bit uncomfortable doing it? Would you feel a bit creepy? Then maybe that's a sign that you don't really need it after all. Because, guess what? You <em>are</em> asking real people. Even if they don't understand it themselves, it's up to you to guide them.</p>

    <p>Imagine you were the personal representative of Zoom and were signing up a family in person to use your product. Imagine you had to ask the parents if it was okay that the transcripts of their kids' video calls were going to be sold to Facebook to target ads. It would be pretty awkward, right? Instead, what happens is that they sneak it past you in a densely worded privacy policy that you're encouraged to skip right over. In Zoom's case, they were found out and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/zoom-privacy-data-facebook-video-chat-app-lawsuit-a9438376.html">publicly shamed</a> and they changed their policy, which is great. But it didn't take a genius to work out that it would have failed a sniff-test before that.</p>

    <h2>In summary</h2>

    <p>Think about what pieces of data you need to know about people who use your products.</p>
    <p>Ask for them clearly and explain why you need them.</p>
    <p>Don't take anything else because <strong>you will probably never use it anyway</strong>.</p>
    <p>And always delete things you don't need because otherwise you're wasting energy and contributing to climate change.</p>
