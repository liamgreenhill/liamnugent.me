If you're interested, read about [How to Get a Dysfunctional Team Back on Track](https://alistapart.com/article/dysfunctional-teams-back-on-track/) on the webzine from the people who literally wrote the book on [Designing with Web Standards](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Web-Standards-Jeffrey-Zeldman/dp/0735712018/ref=sr_1_3), [Responsive Web Design](https://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design), [Mobile First Design](https://abookapart.com/products/mobile-first), and many, many more. 

I'm now starting to wonder why I know so much about trying to fix misfiring software teams... Hang on!! Maybe it's me... I'm the problem!
