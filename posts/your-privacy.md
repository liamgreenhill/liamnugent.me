This is not a commercial website and, when I thought about it, I realised that there is simply nothing about you that I categorically need to know! It’s not that I’m not interested in you. It’s just that it’s really none of my business.

I’ve resisted the temptation to have a sneaky peek at where you are, what phone you have, when you were here. I don’t use any analytics tracking software. No Google Analytics. No Facebook pixels. No cookie files. Nothing. You can come and go as you please. :-)

Sure, on a commercial website, some things do need to be measured and there are ways and means to do that—but not here. No-one likes a creep.

Read the full [privacy policy](/privacy), in all it’s simplified beauty!
