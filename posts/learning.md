When do you get the time to learn?
Is it at work?
Is it at home? But is that at the expense of spending time with people you love?
"What are you doing?", they say.

Why do you learn?
Is it because you feel you have to?
Is it because you want to?
Is it because you have a defined goal or is because you somehow need to feel progress for its own sake?

If you learn at work, do you learn things that you _want_ to learn about? Or is it things that you _have_ to learn about?
Is one better than the other?

Or should you do nothing?
