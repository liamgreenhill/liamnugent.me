I’m the design wizard. If I don’t know what to do, how on earth can I expect a muggle to tell me?

I'm currently working on a website for a large pensions provider in the UK. Here, we generally call all types of 401k, or retirement savings plans, pensions.

The audience for this website can be split into three main groups:
- individuals who contribute to or have money invested in the pension fund
- people or organizations who contribute money on behalf of their employees
- bookkeeping or payroll firms who act on behalf of the employers

To this point, the pension provider has used the following labels to describe the three groups:
- Members, to mean the individuals
- Employers
- Advisers

And these three groups naturally became the three options at the highest level of navigation on the website.

When I approached this project, I queried the use of the term "members". Although the legal name for these people is, strictly speaking, members, I felt that it didn't really resonate with the people who were meant to identify with it.

For me, to become a member of something, it would be usual that the person would _know_ that they had applied and been accepted to some kind of club. In this case, many 'members' don't even know that they are members. Often the employer will add them to the pension scheme without the person really engaging with the process because, in the UK, we have a concept of 'auto enrolment' which forces employers and people to save for their retirement. Basically, it's the law. When you get a job, your company must set you up and you both start contributing to the fund whether you like it or not.

Therefore, many of the people who are auto enrolled in this pension scheme are not particularly familiar with pensions or the language that is used around them. For some, this will be the first and only interaction they have with a pension fund.

Getting back to the point, even though the pension company thinks of these people as members, and calls them that correctly, the people themselves don't recognise the term. It always rankled with me so I proposed changing it.

I didn't have to look far to find another label to use. Every UK high street bank and most of the other major providers use the term 'personal' to refer to financial services that a person can use. It seemed like a straightforward change that wouldn't cause any controversy to retire (sorry, couldn’t resist) ‘member’ and use ‘personal’ instead.

But the organization resisted and pushed back hard asking for 'robust user testing' to provide evidence for the change. They cited previous user tests which hadn't shown any significant issue with using 'member'. This is where I stumble.

## What do _they_ know?

If you ask someone what they think, there's a good chance that [they'll tell you](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/why-we-need-answers). Depending on how you frame the question, you'll influence the answer.

In this case, I strongly suspected some [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) was at play. If I was being unkind, I would say that the only people in the history of the world who would understand the term 'member' in this context would be the staff of the pension provider itself! The huge numbers of 'members' who never even activate their online accounts are invisible and ignored because they don't even know that they _are_ members!

So how does one prove a lack of something against an apparent body of evidence? Maybe you don't...


## The indelible truth

In 2018, I watched a talk by [Luke Wroblewski](https://www.lukew.com/) at [An Event Apart in Chicago](https://aneventapart.com/event/chicago-2018). One of the many things that he covered was the idea that design by iteration has its place BUT step changes in improvements sometimes come from bolder decisions made by "us" — the experts!

He quoted something [Bruce Sterling said in 2005](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/shaping-things).

> There isn’t enough time in the world for people to sacrifice infinite amounts of opportunity and cognition. It follows that much of this activity should be done for us by other people. A class of aware, well-informed, trained and educated people…
>  
> People who will make it their professional business, no, even their calling, their practice, their very mode of being –to create a human-object relationship that is as advanced as we can manage while still being acceptable. Who would that be then?  
> Designers. Who else is there?



# What's my point?

I think it is a dereliction of duty to push design decisions onto users by a process of lazy user testing. It is a cop out. It's too easy to let something through because "it tested well". If the outcomes are terrible, it's not the fault of the poor user testers. How are they supposed to know?? 

It's our job to come up with the ideas. It's our job to be rigorous. It's our job to ask ourselves, "does this feel weird?" and to strive to remove the technical complexity (either in concept or just in language) and make humans happy. It's our job to know what the latest and best thinking is. It's our job to stick our neck out and have the confidence to say, "we should do it this way — trust me".

User testing should be showing some people a building with a green door or a red door and asking them which option they would use to enter. It shouldn't be showing them a blank wall and asking them how they would get inside.
