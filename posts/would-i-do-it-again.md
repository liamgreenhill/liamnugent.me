## No goals
I listened to https://www.twitter.com/jasonfried talking on Clubhouse today answer a question about how he judges success. 
By success I'm taking about glory in any field. Whether that's a work project, side hustle, or personal life. 

His response was that he asks himself, "would I do it again?".

That's great advice.
