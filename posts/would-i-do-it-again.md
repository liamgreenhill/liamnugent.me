description: How do you measure success? How do you know which metrics to track? And how do you decide what the benchmark is for defining success? Jason Fried has a very simple but very effective method.

## No goals
I listened to [Jason Fried](https://www.twitter.com/jasonfried) talking on Clubhouse today answer a question about how he judges success.  By success I'm talking about glory in any field. Whether that’s a work project, side hustle, or personal life. 

His response was that he asks himself, “would I do it again?”.

Nothing more, nothing less. Just... would I do that again? Most of the time that yields a simple and obvious yes/no which answers nearly everything that matters.

Diving deeper into that, I think he’s onto something. I think we lose sight of the fact that metrics are an abstraction. They are an attempt to codify, rationalise or scale good judgement. BUT they are not a replacement for good judgement itself - which in itself is an intuition or a sythnesis (conscious and unconscious) of *all* the information that you gather doing [a thing]. Our human brains are wonderful things which manage this calculation at a level much deeper than we are probably aware.

So asking that almost primal question — would I do it again? — helps us cut through the noise of data and numbers to tap directly back into fact that _we doubtless already know the answer_!
