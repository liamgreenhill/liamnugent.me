## Emotional design

> Products are designed to be useful for us, but sometimes we want products that make us feel good.

I get that product managers want their products to be sticky. I understand that the holy grail of emotional design is for users to _feel_ good about using using your product.
When it is done well, it totally works. I’ve watched 


## Why do we do it?
- what's the value for the product?
- what's the value for the user?

## Here's a bad example:
I was logging into my Virgin Media app to try and investigate why my connection was poor. So I might not be in the best frame of mind.

After logging in, but crucually before I could access the app, I was forced to choose an avatar and username to 'personalise my profile'. 

It seems inoccuous but I didn't want to identfy myself with any of the avatars they offered. I don't need to have forced fun. I just want to get in to my app and test my broadband connection.

I don't see any value in there being a wee avatar on my app. I don't feel like Virgin 'get me'. In fact, I picked a random avatar. And now each time I log in and see the avatar, I will be reminded of how annoyed I feel at the moment.
