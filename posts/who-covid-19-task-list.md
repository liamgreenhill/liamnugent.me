A few weeks ago, I wrote about how I volunteered to take part in sessions with the WHO and Gerry McGovern. The purpose was to help create a list of tasks that the WHO could use to survey their website users and ask them to identify what's important to them.

I joined three of the four public sessions and listened to the research findings, advice and input from content specialists, information architecture and user experience experts, public policy-makers, and many more besides. We started with a collation of several sources of raw data and then honed that to produce the list below.

The tasklist below has now been signed off by WHO and will soon be launched as part of a survey on the WHO website.

To quote [Brian Lamb](), who led this work, 

> This tasklist is due to the work of hundreds of experts and extensive research on what people need. It is an initiative driven by WHO and particularly supported by health organizations from Ireland, Canada, Norway, UK, New Zealand, and Belgium, and the contributions of individuals from many other countries. Please feel free to use to the benefit of humanity. If you could like to run an adapted version of this survey in your country, please get in touch, it’s free.
