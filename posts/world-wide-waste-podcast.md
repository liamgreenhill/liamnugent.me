## World Wide Wasting it again

Having gone through the process of clearing out all of the physical and digital detritus left behind when we closed [Greenhill](https://www.greenhilldigital.com/) last year, I was blown away by the amount of data and tools that we had accumulated.

I spoke to Gerry McGovern about it and the discussion led to me recording a podcast with him today for his [World Wide Waste podcast series](https://www.thisishcd.com/show/world-wide-waste-with-gerry-mcgovern).

It sounds like it will be a few months before it hits an audio player near you but in the meantime, check out some of [the other episodes](https://www.thisishcd.com/show/world-wide-waste-with-gerry-mcgovern).
