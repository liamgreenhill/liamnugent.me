## User tracking is far worse than you think

I saw today a [tweet from Dave Rupert](https://twitter.com/davatron5000/status/1308416904512647172) about [Blacklight](https://themarkup.org/blacklight).

This is the first I’ve heard of this tool which scans any website to reveal how much it tracks you as you use it. It’s like the gross bit of the Gordon Ramsay hotel show where he shines a blacklight on the bed to induce some dry retching because the sheets on the bed have a lot of suspicious stains that aren't visible to the naked eye.

Being a navel-gazer, the first website I tried was this one. In my [privacy statement](https://liamnugent.me/privacy/), I am very clear about how this site doesn’t track you _in any way_. But now you don’t just need to take my word for it.

Here is an independent, third-party source confirming it:
