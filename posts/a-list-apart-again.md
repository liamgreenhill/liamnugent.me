I’ve had another article published on A List Apart. This time, I am writing about [how to build products that stick](https://alistapart.com/article/from-beta-to-bedrock-build-products-that-stick/).

A List Apart is the OG webzine from the people who literally wrote the book on [Designing with Web Standards](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Web-Standards-Jeffrey-Zeldman/dp/0735712018/ref=sr_1_3), [Responsive Web Design](https://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design), [Mobile First Design](https://abookapart.com/products/mobile-first), and many, many more.
