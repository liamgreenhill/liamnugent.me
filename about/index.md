## About this website

For those interested in how the site was put together and why it looks like it does. Here goes...

This website is static and has been hand-coded starting from HTML5 Boilerplate.

It's a bit of an experiment where I'm trying to make this as lightweight and as accessible as possible. There are a few reasons for this. I'm keen to just try it and see how far I can take it. I'm also conscious that coding websites can get complicated very quickly and it's very easy to find yourself fighting against the browser or the environment so, in this case, I'm doing it Judo-style. I intend to harness all the goodness that browser builders try to give you for speed, layout and accessibility.

I'm also very aware that it would be really easy to spin up another CMS-based website or framework-based website that comes bundled with kilobytes or even megabytes of unnecessary code. And that every time someone looks at it that means that more energy has been wasted moving that code around the internet to get it to your screen. So this is my small act of protest to help reduce digital waste.

I'm trying to write semantic HTML and let the browser defaults do as much of the work in displaying the content as I can.

There's no JavaScript being used at all.

CSS styles have been kept to an absolute minimum.

Navigation is deliberately near the bottom of the page to (i) get it out of the way of the actual content on the page and (ii) make it easier to tap with your thumb when you're holding a phone.

## Privacy and tracking

This is not a commercial website and, when I thought about it, I realised that there is simply nothing about you that I categorically need to know! It's not that I'm not interested in you. It's just that it's really none of my business.

I've resisted the urge to use Google Analytics on the site myself so I collect no data about you. No Facebook pixels. No cookie files. Nothing. You can come and go as you please. :-)

Sure, on a commercial website, some things do need to be measured and there are ways and means to do thatâ€”but not here. No-one likes a creep.
