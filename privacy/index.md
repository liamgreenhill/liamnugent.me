## Principles

1. I don't know anything about you.
2. I don't want to know anything about you, in the nicest possible way.
3. If I find that, unknowingly, I know something about you—know that I don't want to know it and I will give your data back to you, if you want it. I'll also delete it as soon as is practically possible.
4. If _you_ find that, unknowingly, I know something about you—know that I don't want to know that either. Please [email me](mailto:liam@greenhilldigital.com) with the details and I will give your data back to you, if you want it. I'll also delete it as soon as is practically possible.
