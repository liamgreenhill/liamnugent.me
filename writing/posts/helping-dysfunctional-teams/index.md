title: How to get a dysfunctional product team back on track

date: 2020-04-15

standfirst: Some advice on how to face up to reality when things don't go well along with some practical steps on how to turn it around.
---

Maybe you've been part of a team that you've seen slowly slide into a rut. Maybe you didn't see it happen but you're now not shipping anything, no-one's talking to each other and the business's Eye of Sauron has cast its gaze on you.

Maybe you've just joined a team that's in the doldrums.

Maybe the people who used to oil the wheels that kept everyone together have moved on and you're having to face facts— you all hate each other.

However you've ended up here, the fact is that you're now here and it's up to someone to do something about it. And that person might be you.

Congratulations.
If you're reading this, you're the top one percent of all ~~naval aviators~~ product managers.
We're going to send you up against the ~~best~~ worst.
You are going to ~~Top Gun~~ The Give-a-Fck Department.

## Accept.

Acknowledge whatever has happened to get you into this predicament. Take some notes about it to use in team appraisals and retrospectives. Take a long hard look at yourself too.

Write a concise, impersonal summary of where you are. Try not to write it from your point of view. Imagine that you're in your boss' seat and just give them the facts as they are. Don't dress things up to make them sound better. Don't over-exaggerate the bad. Leave the emotions to the side.

When you can see your situation clearly, you'll make better decisions.

Avoid the temptation to keep it off-the-record and only discuss it on the telephone or in person. There's nothing to be scared of by writing it down. If it turns out that you're wrong about something, you can always admit it and update your summary. If you don't write it down then there's always scope for misunderstanding or misremembering.

## Rejoice.

Once you've written your summary, forget about it!

I'll let you into a secret. No-one else is interested in how you got here. They might be asking you about it (probably because they are scared that someone will ask them) but *they're aways going to be more interested in how you're going to sort the problem out.*

So don't waste time pointing fingers. Don't prepare slide decks to throw someone under the bus. (Tag that advice with a more general "don't be an asshole" rule.)

If you're getting consistent heat about the past it's because you're not doing a good enough job filling the bandwidth with a solid, robust and realistic plan for getting out of the mess.

So focus on the future.

Sometimes it's not easy to do that but remember that none of this is permanent. Trust in the fact that if you pull it together you'll be in a much more powerful position to decide what to do next. 

Maybe the team will hold together with a new culture or, if it is irretrievably broken, once you're out of the hole then you can do something about it and switch teams or even switch jobs. But be the person who sorted it out, or at the very least, be part of the people who sorted it out. That will be obvious to outsiders and makes for a much better interview question response.

"All of this will pass. All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well."

## Move on.

"You're a hell of a ~~pilot~~ manager. Maybe too good."

As a product manager, you maybe want to start getting in everyone's face. You want to rely on your unlimited reserves of personal charm or enthusiasm to vibe everyone up. Resist! Don't! 

Your job is to give people the space to let them do their best work.

Don't micro manage. In fact scrap all of your management tricks. Your job is to listen to what people are telling you—even if they're telling you things by not talking.

Re-frame the current problem. Break it up into manageable chunks.

The first task to add to your list of things to do is to "Decide what we're going to do about XXXX".

It seems weird, but break out the nub of the problem into an item of its own on JIRA, or BaseCamp, or whatever it is that you use. It's likely that there's a nasty ticket in the middle of this that everyone is avoiding or has been bounced around. Set that aside. There's too much emotional content invested in that ticket now. Create a new one which is about making a decision. Then from that, create a smaller task for each member of the team like "Submit a proposal for what to do next". Put your own suggestions in the mix but do your best to disassociate yourself from them.

Once you start getting some suggestions back and can tick those tasks off the list, you start to generate positive momentum. Nurture that.

If a plan emerges, champion it. Be wary of naysayers. Challenge them respectfully with "how do *you* think we should...?" questions. If they have a better idea, champion that, if they don't respond at all then gently suggest "maybe we should go with this, if no-one else has a better idea".

Avoid words like "need", "just", "one" or "small". Basically, anything that imposes a view of other people's work. It seems trivial but try to see it from the other side. 

Saying "I just need you to change that one small thing" hits the morale-killing jackpot. It unthinkingly diminishes the someone else's efforts. An engineer or a designer could reasonably react by thinking "what do you know about how to do this?!". Your job is to help everyone drop their guard and feel safe enough to contribute.

Instead, try "We're all looking at you here because you're good at this and this is a naaasty problem. Maybe you know a way to make this part work?".

More often than not, people want to help.

## Tell people about it

Once you've got a plan, commit to it and tell everyone affected what's going on.

When communicating up the way, take the last line of your email, which usually contains the summary or the 'ask', and put it at the top. When your recipient reads the message, the opener is the meat. Good news or bad news, that's what they're interested in. They'll read on if they want more.

If it's bad news, set someone up for it with a simple "I'm sorry to say I've got bad news" before you break it to them. No matter who they are, that will help them digest it.

When discussing it with the team, put the plan somewhere everyone can see it. Transparency is key.

Don't pull any moves like publishing deadline dates to the team that are 2 weeks earlier than the date you've told the business. Teams aren't stupid. They'll know that's what you do.

 Publish the dates somewhere everyone in the team can see and say *we're* aiming for this date but we're telling the *business* that we'll definitely be done by this date.

Estimating is a whole other subject that I won't cover here. Checkout the Shape Up(basecamp shape up) process for some great advice on that.

## For example

Here's a real life example, with some of the steps we took to get over the issue. Names and details have been changed to protect the innocent.

Jen was working with me on a new feature on our product that lets people create new meal recipes themselves. We were working in six-week cycles.

iShe had to rely on an API that was managed by Tom (who was in another team) to allow her to get and set the new recipe information on a central database. Before we kicked off, everyone knew the overall objective and everyone was all smiles and ready to go.

The architecture was a legacy mish-mash of different parts of local databases and API functions. And, no prizes for guessing what's coming next, the API documentation was like Swiss cheese.

Two weeks in to a six week cycle, Jen hit Tom up with a list of her dream API calls that she wanted to use to build her feature. She asked him to confirm or deny they would work or even if they existed at all because once she started digging, it wasn't clear to her.

However, Tom had form for sticking his head in the sand and not responding to requests he didn't like. Tom went to ground and didn't respond. Tom's manager, Frankie, was stretched too thin so wasn't paying attention to this until I was persistently asking about it, in increasingly fraught tones.

In the meantime, Jen tried to do as much as she could. Every day she built a bit more based on her as-yet unapproved design, hoping it would all work out.

We got to the end of week 4 and Tom eventually responded with a short answer which boiled down to "The API doesn't support these calls and I don't see why I should build something to provide them. Why don't you get the data from the other part of the system? And if I'm forced to do this, it will take at least 6 weeks."

And as we know, 6 into 2 doesn't go. Problem.

How did we overcome it?

#1 - Accept

We summarised how we'd ended up here.

The salient points from our summary were:

- I hadn't checked that we had scoped it properly before even committing to this work. It wasn't a surprise that the API coverage was patchy but I turned a blind eye because we were excited about the new feature.
- Jen should have looked for the hard problem first rather than do a couple of weeks worth of nice easy work around the edges. That's why we lost 2 weeks off the top.
- Tom and Frankie's communication was poor. The reasons for that don't form part of this discussion but something isn't right in that team.

#2 - Rejoice

We had a short call (10 mins) with everyone involved on the line. We read out the summary and asked if anyone had anything to add.

Tom spoke up and said that he never gets time to update the documentation because he always has to work on emergencies. We added that to our summary:

- Tom has an ongoing time management problem. He doesn't have enough time allocated to maintain and improve the API documentation.

After that was added, everyone agreed that the summary was accurate.

I explained that the worst thing that could happen now was that we had to report back to the wider business that we'd messed up and couldn't do it. We'd lose face. There would be real financial consequences. It would show up on our appraisals. It wouldn't be good. It wouldn't be the end of the world, but it wasn't something that we wanted. Everyone probably knew that already, but there's a power in saying it out loud. Suddenly, it doesn't seem so scary.

Jen spoke up to say that she was new here and really didn't want to start out like this. There was some murmuring in general support. I wrapped up that part of the discussion.

I moved on to say that we were parking the main ticket that had being hanging around everyone's in-tray for 4 weeks.

I explained that I'd be in touch with details of a new task which was to "Decide how to bridge the gap between what the API provides and what we need for this new feature". And, as per the process, I would give everyone an individual task to respond with their suggestions in writing.

I purposefully didn't enter into a discussion about it. We had all come together to admit the circumstances we were in. We'd done that. It was enough for now.

#3 - Move on

I asked everyone to submit their proposals for a way through the mess.

It wasn't straightforward. Just because we'd all agreed how we got here didn't just magically make all the problems disappear. Tom was still digging his heels in about not wanting to write more code and kept pushing back on Jen.

There was a certain amount of back and forth. Although, with some constant reminders that we should maybe focus on what will move us forward, we eventually settled on a plan.

Like most compromises, it wasn't pretty or simple. Jen was going to have to rely on using the local database for a certain amount of the lower-priority features. Tom was going to have to create some additional API functions and would end up with some unnecessary traffic that might create too much load on the API.

And even with the compromise, Tom wouldn't be finished in time. He'd need another couple of weeks.

But it was a plan!

#4 - Tell everyone

I posted an update to the rest of the business as part of our normal weekly reporting cycle to announce that we had hit a bump which was going to affect our end date.

Here's an extract:

> Hi everyone,
> 
> here's the update for the week. I'm afraid there's a bit of bad news but there's some good news to follow.
> 
> **Summary**
> 
> - We uncovered a misunderstanding between Jen and Tom this week. The outcome is that Tom has more API work to do that he anticipated. This affects the delivery date and means we're now planning to finish 10 working days later on November 22.
> 
> - We successfully released version 1.0 of the app into the App Store 🎉.
> 
> **Expected completion date** **** CHANGED ****
> 
> Original estimate: November 8
> 
> Current estimate: **November 22**
> 
> and so on...

That post was available for everyone within the team to see. Everyone knew what was to be done and what the target was.

I had to field some questions from above but I was ready with my summary that we'd all agreed. All I had to do was refer to it. Then I could focus on sharing the plan we had to sort it out.

Now, I'd like to say that we then had tea and scones every day for the next month and it all ended spiffingly. But that would be a lie.

There was some more wailing and gnashing of teeth but we all got through it and, even though we tried and failed to finish early, we did manage to finish by the Nov 22 date.

And then, after a bit of a tidy up, we all moved onto the next project; a bit older and a bit wiser.

I hope that helps you if you're in a similar scenario. [Send me a tweet](https://twitter.com/liamjnugent/) with any questions or comments. I've love to hear about your techniques and advice.
